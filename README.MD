# Mem Reduct Console (C++ Rewrite)

Mem Reduct Console is a **console-only C++ rewrite** of the original
**Mem Reduct** project by Henry++.

This version consolidates the original multi-file C codebase into a
single C++ source file and removes all graphical user interface components.
The default memory cleanup behavior executes automatically when the program
is launched.

## Overview

This project is a **derived and rewritten implementation** of Mem Reduct,
originally developed by Henry++, with the following changes:

- Rewritten from C into C++
- Consolidated into a single `.cpp` source file
- Graphical user interface fully removed
- Console-only execution
- Default cleanup routine runs automatically on launch

Although the code structure differs significantly from upstream, the
core logic and behavior are derived from the original Mem Reduct project.
